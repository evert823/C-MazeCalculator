# C-MazeCalculator
Maze stuff with C#

This is a C# project for rextangular mazes of any size.
The GUI is very minimal, but it will allow you to produce a png image.
It also supports a text format so that mazes can be saved into and loaded from textfiles.

What it currently supports is:
- Generate a perfect maze
- Find the path between two given points
- Find the most distant point from a given point
- Find the longest path possible in the current maze (*)

(*) This option will be very time taking for larger mazes.
